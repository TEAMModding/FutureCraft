# FutureCraft
A mod that adds futuristic stuff to Minecraft.

To-do list:

1. Get the electrical system back and working and removing the errors in them.

2. Make a simple rocket system, no entities yet, just teleportation first. Then i'll work on a gui simulation of flying through
space and orbiting to actually get to the planet you want to get to. Then, if it's possible and we get good enough, make the player
actually able to move around in the spaceship while in space, do spacewalks, and meet with other ships in space.That will be the
hardest part of the mod but if we get it working it will be awesome. And as kal says i'll probably be doing all the physics
so i'll probably be doing all this on my own....

3. Make a better system for planets, simply specifying orbital and physical parameters of a planet to put it in the game instead
of hardcoding it.

4. Make a simple sky renderer for planets, rendering moons, daylight cycles, and atmospheres based on the planet's parameters.

5. Make a bunch of cool gadgets such as lazers, tools based off lightsabers, jetpacks, stuff like that. This is gonna be a fun one.

6. Make a procuderally generated planet system, after we do the better planet system.

7. Make every single planet and moon in the solar system. This will require real images of each planet's surface. I have no idea
where to get these but if anyone knows that would be great.

8. Possibly add an rpg-like system for alien life. Otherwise, we'll just make them as dumb as villagers.
