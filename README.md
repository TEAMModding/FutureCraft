# FutureCraft
A mod that adds futuristic stuff to Minecraft.


### Some general guidelines on contributing to this mod:

Try to make all commits as small as possible. 
An individual commit should only change or add one feature.
This way, when working in a branch, others can contribute to small changes. It also reduces the chance of conflicts.

Generally, large new features that require multiple commits should be added in a new branch.
To add a new branch in eclipse: right click the project, and go to team>switch to>new branch, and name your branch.
Alternately, if you have the git toolbar enabled, you can just click (checkout branch, tag, or reference).
Once a branch is ready to be added to the main branch, click "new pull request" above. A pull request will be stored on the GitHub site, and i'll look through the changes to see if it should be added to the main branch.
